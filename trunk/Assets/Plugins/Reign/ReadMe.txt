For in depth documentation please go to: http://www.reign-studios.net/docs/unity-plugin/
Post build steps will be explained there for each supported platform.

----------------------------
Getting Started
----------------------------
Open one of the scenes from: "Assets/Scenes/Reign/...".
And look at ".cs" files for reference.
Make sure you have the "Assets\Plugins\Reign\Services\ReignServices.prefab" in the Scene for the plugins to work.

----------------------------
Prerequisite before Building
----------------------------
Go to the menu option "Edit->Reign->Set Platform->..." and select your target platform.
This will disable conflicting ".dll" plugin libs from other Reign Unity Plugins.
NOTE: Before you commit your changes to a version control, please run "Edit->Reign->Set Platform->Revert".

----------------------------
Updating
----------------------------
If you have multiple Reign Unity Plugins its a good idea to check and make sure there versions are in sync via "Edit->Reign->Check Plugin Sync".
If they are not or you are having issues run "Edit->Reign->Check for Updates".
Or you can download up to date packages via: "Edit->Reign->Bleeding Edge Packages".
